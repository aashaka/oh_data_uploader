This is a Django project that functions as a
file uploader for individual *Open Humans* projects. It can easily be deployed to
*heroku* and all the configuration can be done through your web browser once the project is deployed. A step-by-step guide can be found below

## Deployment to *heroku*.

This is a 5-Step guide to get your own Open Humans data upload project up and running. It does not require neither programming nor command line experience.

### **Step 1**: Click the *deploy to heroku* button above.

Log in into your existing *heroku* account or create a new one. (This Uploader is designed to completely work with the free tier of *heroku*, so you don't have to give them any payment details).

### **Step 2**: Fill out the parameters that *heroku* asks you

(see screenshot below).

![](docs/deploy_heroku.png)

*heroku* asks you to give your app a name, for this demo we use `ohuploadertemplatetest`. Repeat this name below for the `HEROKUCONFIG_APP_NAME`. The second important parameter is the `ADMIN_PASSWORD`. You will later need this to connect your uploader to *Open Humans* and to customize your uploader. Once you have entered this information you click on *deploy app* and after a while you should get a success message.

If you have given `ohuploadertemplatetest` as the `HEROKUCONFIG_APP_NAME` your uploader should be available at `https://ohuploadertemplatetest.herokuapp.com/`.

### **Step 3**: Create your project on *Open Humans*

On *Open Humans* you can create a new project by [clicking on *create a new OAuth2 data request project*](https://www.openhumans.org/direct-sharing/projects/manage/).

![](docs/oh_config.png)

Fill out the form and enter all the required information. The most important to make sure that your uploader will work is the *Redirect URL*, which will be set depending on your *App name*. If your app's main page is `https://ohuploadertemplatetest.herokuapp.com/`, then the `REDIRECT URL` should be `https://ohuploadertemplatetest.herokuapp.com/complete`.

### **Step 4**: Grab your Oauth credentials from *Open Humans*

Once you click on save in **Step 3** you should come back to the list of all projects you are currently running. This should now contain your new project.

![](docs/oh_projects.png)

Click on the name of your new project and this new page you will see your `CLIENT ID` and `CLIENT SECRET`. This are the two missing bits of information that you will need to connect your new *heroku* Uploader app to *Open Humans*.

![](docs/oh_oauth.png)

### **Step 5**: Finalize your Uploader setup

You can now go to `https://HEROKUCONFIG_APP_NAME.herokuapp.com/project-admin/login` (replace `HEROKUCONFIG_APP_NAME` with the name you gave in *Step 2*) and use the `ADMIN_PASSWORD` you gave in *Step 2* to log in.

![](docs/template_setup.png)

Once logged in you will see a page that gives you all options to edit your template and make it work for your own project. As a most important, first step you should start by clicking `Edit Open Humans settings`. Here you can enter the `CLIENT ID` and `CLIENT SECRET` that you looked up in *Step 4*. Afterwards you can edit more things about your project like:
- the Title & Description
- the metadata used for the uploaded files
- all the texts that should appear on your uploader website.

This last bit is done [by writing Markdown formatted text right into the forms](https://help.github.com/articles/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax/).

## Local Deployment and Development
The *Open Humans Uploader* is written in *Python 3.6+*, uses the *Django 2.0* framework and is designed to be ultimately deployed
to *Heroku*. You will need some additional modules and packages to locally experiment with this uploader template or to develop it further. A full step-by-step guide that should work for Mac OS (and with minor differences for Linux) [can be found in the INSTALL.md](https://github.com/gedankenstuecke/oh_data_uploader/blob/master/INSTALL.md).
